          Lincoln was born in a backwoods cabin 3 miles (5 km) south of
          Hodgenville, Kentucky, and was taken to a farm in the neighbouring
          valley of Knob Creek when he was two years old. His earliest memories
          were of this home and, in particular, of a flash flood that once
          washed away the corn and pumpkin seeds he had helped his father plant.
          His father, Thomas Lincoln, was the descendant of a weaver’s
          apprentice who had migrated from England to Massachusetts in 1637.
          Though much less prosperous than some of his Lincoln forebears, Thomas
          was a sturdy pioneer. On June 12, 1806, he married Nancy Hanks. The
          Hanks genealogy is difficult to trace, but Nancy appears to have been
          of illegitimate birth. She has been described as “stoop-shouldered,
          thin-breasted, sad,” and fervently religious. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln
          had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died in infancy.
